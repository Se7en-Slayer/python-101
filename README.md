Python Fundamentals

Welcome to an introduction to Python and Programming. 
My goal with this series is to do things a bit different than you usually see with programming tutorials. 
The problem with most basics tutorials is they just cover the syntax of a language and use a toy example per new concept, 
repeating this through up to 100s of things like statements, methods and other paradigms of programming.
